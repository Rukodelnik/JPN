                Mount Moiwa (<span class="japanese-text">藻岩山</span>, Moiwa-yama) is one of several small, forested mountains southwest of central Sapporo. The mountain is a popular sightseeing spot that is known for the spectacular view out over the city from an observation deck at its summit. The view is especially beautiful after sunset.

                The Mount Moiwa Ropeway climbs from the base of the mountain three quarters up the mountain to a transfer station. From there a rather unique mini cablecar travels the rest of the way to the upper station at the summit where there is an observation deck and restaurant with nice views out over the city. The station also houses a planetarium and theater. The ropeway and building complex at the summit were reopened in 2012 after extensive renovations.

                The Mount Moiwa Ski Resort lies on the mountain's southeastern slope. This skier-only resort has several runs and is close to Sapporo City; however, it is approached from a different direction than the Mount Moiwa Ropeway.
