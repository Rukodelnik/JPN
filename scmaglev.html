                Opened in 2011, the SCMAGLEV and Railway Park is the railway museum of Central Japan Railways (JR Central). The museum seeks to educate visitors on the advances in high speed rail in Japan and displays a number of actual trains, including historic steam locomotives, world record setting experimental shinkansen (bullet train) and the latest magnetic levitating trains (maglev).

                Several dozen retired train cars are on display. Many of them can be entered or viewed from underneath, and are accompanied by a host of exhibits explaining the different parts of the trains and all aspects of their operation and maintenance. Another section of the museum is dedicated to maglev trains and JR Central's plans to construct a maglev high speed link between Tokyo and Osaka. The second floor of the museum also has lots of learning experiences, which are specifically geared toward young children.

                Some of the most popular attractions are the train simulators, which include driving simulators for conventional and shinkansen trains, and a train crew simulator where you can experience the duties of a train conductor in charge of opening and closing the doors. The simulators cost an additional fee (either 100 or 500 yen).

                The museum also houses one of Japan's largest train dioramas with miniature trains running through detailed recreations of Osaka, Nagoya and Tokyo. Another collection displays historical artifacts from the early days of Japanese railways. A free English audio guide is available for rent which provides detailed explanations of the museum exhibits.
