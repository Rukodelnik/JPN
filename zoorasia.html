                Zoorasia (<span class="japanese-text">ズーラシア</span>) is one of Japan's newest, largest and best kept zoos. The zoo was established in 1999, and since then has been operating under the themes of "Symbiosis of Life" and "Harmony with Nature". The animals are generally kept in spacious areas that mimic their natural habitat to a degree that is not usually seen in Japanese zoos.

                The animal exhibitions of Zoorasia are spread out amongst eight ecological areas: Asian Tropical Forest, Subarctic Forest, Oceanian Grassland, Central Asian Highland, Japanese Countryside, Amazon Jungle, African Tropical Rainforest and African Savannah. Among the zoo's highlights are the elephants, polar bears, black bears, okapi and proboscis monkeys. There are also a few restaurants and cafes, as well as nature trails and recreation areas for kids.
